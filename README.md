# jump-game-problem
just a basic problem solution.

You are given an integer array nums(i don't know how to create an array with as many elements as the number entered by the user in c, so i did it with an array which has 5 elements.) . You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
